        echo "<p>I went to see, “First Man,” the movie about NASA’s mission to put a man on the moon, told from the perspective of Neil Armstrong and his family. It definitely shows those original astronauts in a different light than we’re used to from Hollywood whitewashes, which was good, but overall the picture falls a little flat for me. It loses major points because of the shaky, hand-held camera work, as if someone was following Armstrong around with a Super 8. That really annoys me, plus all the camera movement makes me a little sick so I have to take my eyes off the screen. I could go on about why I think that is a dumb cinematic choice, but this isn’t a film review.</p>
<p>The story also takes a glimpse of the controversy over spending so much money on the space race at the time while Vietnam was raging and while the country splintered because of it. People were fighting for their civil rights, fighting to make a living and put food on the table, and we put billions into spaceships. That, of course, was a false choice. We could explore space and make our planet a more equitable place, too. (Spoiler alert: We didn’t.)

<p>Nevertheless, when Armstrong stepped off the lunar module and said those famous words, the world stood in awe. It’s estimated that 600 million people watched and many more than that listened on the radio. Stepping foot on the moon changed us as a country and it stirred in us a sense of national community that expanded our ideas of what is possible. As a country, we used to have big audacious goals; now, everything we do seems so petty. We argue over whether people, our citizens, deserve health care or an education. Healthcare! Education! We are not held in awe any more. We are openly ridiculed for our pettiness.</p>
<p>I was born into the space race and it figured prominently in my imagination and my sense of self. From that perspective, looking at puny earth from space, it all must seem petty. Our priorities are all wrong; our ambitions are small; we fight over the wrong things, and we elect the wrong people. We have a government now that deliberately and maliciously divides us. Instead of a community, we continue to splinter into smaller and smaller tribes. A tribe is different than a community because tribes define themselves in how they are different than everyone else. When there are more and more tribes, it becomes easier to hate each other, easier for our government to manipulate us, and easier to succumb to fear. (Spoiler alert: No matter what side you think you’re on, you are being manipulated.)</p>
<p>What made America great -- briefly -- was not a backward glance or the dredging up of old grievances; we were great because we looked to the future; we took a giant leap into the unknown and the practical, scientific, and theoretical advances we made because of it changed how we see the universe and our place in it. Toxic tribalism is destroying our discourse and our community. One way to combat that, to see the bigger picture, is to become an individual. When you own yourself, you begin a process of enlightenment, of freedom, and you'll begin to question the assumptions imposed on you by your tribe, or the manipulative forces within your tribe. Imagine what it felt like for Armstrong to stand on the moon looking at Earth. Imagine how lonely and yet how liberating it must have felt to be in a place where the petty controversies of the day held no meaning at all. Be like Neil.</p>";
