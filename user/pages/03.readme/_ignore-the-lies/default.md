####[Stop helping Donald Trump spread his lies. Don't correct, don't rage, just turn away.](https://www.usatoday.com/story/opinion/2018/09/10/donald-trump-liar-dont-help-his-lies-go-viral-column/1215197002/)

During the 2016 presidential election, I had argued that media outlets were unwittingly helping Trump and agenda by writing about every idiotic thing he did and said. Not only that, they pasted his picture into every story they could. I had read several that didn't even mention Trump, but his was the header image. Ridiculous. 

I think most people have several issues they care about, and different ways to measure success. Our culture measures success by trending topics, number of likes, shares, and re-tweets. It doesn't matter the topic, good or bad, if it gets the numbers, it's a success. That's how, I think, Trump views the world. The more outrageous a statement, the more mentions = success. If that worked, then saying the opposite a day later would work too; it does. I think it's pretty clear Trump has no real moral compass. As this editorial in [USA Today](https://www.usatoday.com/story/opinion/2018/09/10/donald-trump-liar-dont-help-his-lies-go-viral-column/1215197002/) states, Trump is a liar. Not a liar as we call people to insult them, he is objectively a liar, professionally.And I agree with the general advice in this article: stop being an unpaid volunteer for Trump; stop repurposing his lies by reacting to them with counter posts and tweets. You can't shame him; you shouldn't help him spread his lies.
