People _are_ stupid. I know that because everyone says so; you've said it; I've said it. But my kind of stupid is different than yours. It's like that joke about poker: there's always a sucker at every table, and if you look around but can't figure out who it is, it's you. I state this observation because in our divided country today both sides think the other is stupid. Both are correct.

Right-wing voters are stupid because, well, look who's running the country. Enough said. The left is stupid because as far as I can tell the only thing galvanizing us is our outrage. We commiserate over one outrage after another and fool ourselves into thinking our outrage is somehow influencing the direction the shit storm is flying. We are also stupid for thinking the shit storm started in 2016 when the clown president was elected. It actually started decades earlier. The radical right wing long ago started organizing and investing heavily to get where they are now. They created grass roots organizations as well as elitists ones and recruited people to run them, who in turn recruited candidates to groom for various political offices. Our newest conservative Supreme Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh was a product of this process. The clown president was not part of this club; he became the proverbial guest who wouldn't leave, but the clown also plays the same games. The right has been extremely successful at controlling public discourse, the social media discourse, too. They continue to dominate because we stupidly let them. We fall for the outrage every time.

When I see a post regurgitating the latest stupidity from Washington or someone trying to make a counter point while using a picture of Trump with it, I get a little more dispirited. We are losing because we are talking about their game. I realize we have a pretty good target -- a big, incompetent orange one -- for aiming our outrage, but we also have to acknowledge our own side's stupidity. The Kavanaugh hearings proved to me that the Democratic Party hasn't learned much since 2016. The leadership needs to change; the quality of progressives needs to change, and I'm not sure if we ever demanded justice over the rampant corruption that put Hillary as the de facto candidate in that circus of an election.

Our outage has spawned some outlier democratic socialists and a lot of women candidates, so that's good, but I doubt it's enough. Democrats still do not have a value-based platform, no grand vision or inspiring goals. All they have is a hatred for Trump; as justified as that is, stewing in it won't win elections. Unless we are going to help the circus stay in town for two terms, we have to be smarter. I already wrote that I think we need to stop believing truth and reason will help us; it won't. Perhaps the first step is to define what we want, what we stand for, and just post that, over and over.
