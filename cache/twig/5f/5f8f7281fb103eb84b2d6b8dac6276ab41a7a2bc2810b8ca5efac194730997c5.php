        echo "<p>For a brief time last week, Republican Sen. Jeff Flake was a national hero on the left and an enigma on the right. He temporarily put the brakes on the Kavanaugh hearings allowing the FBI to investigate, sort of, the sexual assault allegation made against the Supreme Court nominee. The cynical view is that Sen. Flake never intended to vote against Kavanaugh and used the investigation as cover for his future political self. Flake quit the senate and has become mercurial within his party because he openly dislikes Trump, but, nevertheless, likes the conservative agenda. The scuttlebutt is that Flake intends to run for president, some day. If true, it was a deft and pragmatic move – though transparent – that will most likely work for him. Yet I am more interested in the respite that investigation gave us all from the outrages of the day and the glimmer of the future you might have missed.</p>
<p>In an interview with Democratic Sen. Chris Coons after the investigation was opened, Flake was asked, if he had not quit the senate, would he have made this move? He said, no. He said that there was no reward in government today for working in a bi-partisan way, to seek compromise. By the end of the week, the country was feeling a bit of relief from the media assault the Kavanaugh hearings brought to us. By that time, too, Flake was making appearances at celebrity filled vigils and rallies and was glad-handed by people on both sides for slowing things down and letting it cool off a bit. Robert De Niro called him a hero; the same De Niro who wants to punch Trump in the face. At that time, Flake told a reporter he could sense that the people he was meeting were thirsty for a bi-partisan government, a moderate voice. Little did they know that he had already made up his mind to vote, yes. </p>
<p>Make no mistake, Flake is not a moderate; he votes along party lines 84% of the time. One thing about Trump, he's easy to dislike. But future presidential candidates like Flake, or Michael Bloomberg, are not so easy to spit at. This makes the Republican \"Anyone but Trump\" movement an interesting matchup in 2020. What if one or many Republicans run against Trump in 2020 Would we have the same circus, or would these contenders be able to spank Trump like the last batch could not do? I'll admit, if it has to be a Rebublican, my life would be much less stressful with someone like Bloomberg in the Whitehouse.</p>
<p>However, here's another one of my dilemmas. Over the last two years, I have confronted, cajoled, lambasted, and reasoned with many, many Trump supporters. With little variation, most them said they voted for Trump because they liked the conservative agenda he proposed. But, I replied, strip away the bombast, and that agenda was the same as the other 17 candidates and the conversative agenda for decades. So with a choice of other conservatives, why Trump?</p>

<p>Of course, our system of government was meant to force compromise, but we have elected such a collection of extremists that it is not possible today, at least not likely. For example, it used to require 3/5 of the Senate to approve a Supreme Court nominee; that’s 60 votes. But in 2017, with a Republican majority, Senate Leader Mitch McConnell overturned the rules so a simple majority – 51 – could stop the debate and call for a vote. That was to get Neil Gorsuch on the court. This was the same nuclear option (actually a parliamentary procedure loophole) Democratic Majority Leader Harry Reid took for the lower courts in 2013, meaning now all nominees for court appointments are approved with a simple majority, that means along partisan lines. The partisan politics that Flake said was ruining government is baked into the rules of government, so a bit of hypocrisy there on all sides.</p>";
