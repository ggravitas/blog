For a brief time last week, Republican Sen. Jeff Flake was a national hero on the left and an enigma on the right. He temporarily put the brakes on the Kavanaugh hearings allowing the FBI to investigate, sort of, the sexual assault allegation made against the Supreme Court nominee. The cynical view is that Sen. Flake never intended to vote against Kavanaugh and used the investigation as cover for his future political self. Flake quit the senate and has become paradoxical within his party because he openly dislikes Trump, but, nevertheless, likes the conservative agenda. The scuttlebutt is that Flake intends to run for president, some day. If true, it was a deft and pragmatic move – though transparent – that will most likely work for him. Yet I am more interested in the respite that investigation gave us all from the outrages of the day and a glimpse of the future.

In an interview with Democratic Sen. Chris Coons after the investigation was opened, Flake was asked, if he had not quit the senate, would he have made this move? He said, no. He said that there was no reward in government today for working in a bi-partisan way. By the end of the week, the country was feeling a bit of relief from the media assault the Kavanaugh hearings brought to us. By that time, too, Flake was making appearances at celebrity filled vigils and rallies and was glad-handed by people on both sides for slowing things down and letting it cool off a bit. Robert De Niro called him a hero; the same De Niro who wants to punch Trump in the face. At that time, Flake told a reporter he could sense that the people he was meeting were thirsty for a bi-partisan government, a moderate voice. Little did they know that he had already made up his mind to vote, yes. 

Make no mistake, Flake is not a moderate; he votes along party lines 84% of the time. But he's likable. One thing about Trump, he's easy to dislike. Future presidential candidates like Flake, will need to be a foil to Trump, same for anyone else. Michael Bloomberg comes to mind. This makes the Republican "Anyone but Trump" movement an interesting matchup in 2020, but how will it be different than 2016? Over the last two years, I have confronted, cajoled, lambasted, and reasoned with many, many Trump supporters. With little variation, most them said they voted for Trump because they liked the conservative agenda he proposed. And I replied that when you strip away the bombast that agenda fairly the same as the other 16 candidates' and as the convservative agenda has been for decades. So with a choice of other real conservatives, why Trump? Not one person answered. It's my suspicion that they either did not know, or did not want to admit the reason. 

Once people crave an authoritarian government, is there a way back?
