####[The Lost Art of Resigning in Protest](https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2018/09/trump-new-york-times-woodward/569635/)
This editorial came out around the time Bob Woodwardâ€™s book, "Fear," was published and the anonymous column in "The New York Times" from a "senior Whitehouse official" that stated, yes, Trump was incompetent, but there were other people there keeping him in check. That was cold comfort, as Dick Polman writes in "[The Atlantic](https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2018/09/trump-new-york-times-woodward/569635/)." Polman points out there was a time when a person's sense of right and wrong, especially in public service, was so astute that they would resign under such circumstances, and say so. Now it seems, public servants have become enablers.
