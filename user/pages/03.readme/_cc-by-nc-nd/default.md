####[Why Trump Supporters Don’t Mind His Lies](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/04/28/opinion/sunday/why-trump-supporters-dont-mind-his-lies.html)
[This editorial](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/04/28/opinion/sunday/why-trump-supporters-dont-mind-his-lies.html) explores recent research into unethical behavior and uses it as an explanation for why Trump’s lies have not generated outrage among his supporters. The theory is that the administration encourages people to reflect on how the lies could have been true, if we lived in an alternate reality. It's of a bit of mental gymnastics, a reason loophole in our brains, that makes the implausible, plausible.
