A few weeks ago, while walking my dog, I found a bunny in West Park. Not a rabiit. The common cottontail has taken over that park. No, these were exotic bunnies, the big, long-haired, floopy-eared Angora type. I called out to a woman who was standing down the way if it was hers. She said she was staring at another one, hiding under a car along the street. We found a third one across the park; it was so friendly that it was hopping up to people and dogs. Obviously, someone had enough of these pets and dumped them in the park; they wouldn't last long. We coralled two of them but the third was so frightened it hunched under the wheel of a parked car shivering. 

The woman called home and after some negotiation said she would adopt them. Meanwhile, a man was guarding the third one in case the owner of the car showed up. When I passed him, I said looks like someone abandoned them. He looked at me, shook his head, and said, "People are stupid."

People _are_ stupid. That means you and me. But my kind of stupid is different than yours. It's like that joke about poker; there's always a sucker at every table, and if you look around but can't figure out who it is, it's you.

I state this obvious fact because in our divided country today, bnoth sides think the other is stupid. Both are right, sometimes.
