A podcast from "[On The Media](https://www.wnycstudios.org/shows/otm)" that examine the "nearly month-long convulsion against the expectations and consequences of the #MeToo era. When we spoke with Slate staff writer Lili Loofbourow last November, she anticipated such a backlash. This was a fitting week to call her up again.
