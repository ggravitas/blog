And like me, I'll wager you failed to reason with them. More often than not, I bet your attempts to communicate ended in a greater divide, name-calling, or silence. We have the moral high ground, but that doesn't matter. We have the truth, data, history, and objective fact on our side, but that doesn't matter either. We have converted zero Trump supporters (according to polls) since the election. So when we debate, our indignation only serves ourselves. </p>
<p>That's fine when we need to vent, but we must stop expecting reason to win the argument. In the attempt, we are unwittingly helping spread the lies. Every time we pounce on an outrageous statement made by Trump or his supporters, we also spread it; we give it oxygen. I'm very interested in the psychology behind what triggers nationalism, tribalism, authoritarianism in our country, which was established in protest of those very things. But understanding it is not going to reverse it; I see no evidence the MAGA folks are trying to understand us.</p>
<p>The only way to defeat this is with numbers: our side is bigger than theirs, so we need to vote. Vote for progressives, vote for moderates, vote for whomever you choose, but vote wisely. And in the meantime, when you have an impulse to comment on an outrageous FB post or write about the latest Trump lie, stop yourself. When a MAGA tries to bait you on your own post, ignore them. Stop helping Trump and his enablers make everything they do a trending topic on social media. I know this is difficult; I can't stop myself sometimes. The dark side has been doing a much better job at manipulating our behavior than we have been at controlling it. We have to be smarter. Please Vote!</p>
