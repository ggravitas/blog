<p>This also sums up what I call a personal manifesto: a guide to what you will and will not do based on your convictions, your code, your beliefs, and your sense of right and wrong. What's difficult about forming a manifesto is consistency because many of these things will be in conflict. Your religion may tell you to believe in one thing, but society, your country, may adopt different values. Reconciling the things you are told to believe with the ideas you choose to believe may be a life-long struggle. It's not as easy as it sounds.</p>

<p>Somewhere in the last few pages, the main character, Stephen Dedalus, is talking to his friend, Cranly, who has a “priestlike face”. In these pages, Cranly questions Stephen about his beliefs. Half annoyed and half inspired, Stephen confesses his beliefs in the form of a manifesto. This manifesto felt so right to me that I copied into the cover of all my school notebooks. Of course, the book has been around since 1916, so it perhaps was already a cliché and a tad pretentious to adopt it, but it serves as an example of what I mean by manifestos and our natural tendency to try and figure ourselves out.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“ __Look here, Cranly, he said. You have asked me what I would and would not do. I will tell you what I will do and what I will not do. I will not serve that in which I no longer believe whether it call itself my home, my fatherland or my church: and I will try to express myself in some mode of life or art as freely as I can and as wholly as I can, using for my defence the only arms I allow myself to use—silence, exile, and cunning.”</p>
