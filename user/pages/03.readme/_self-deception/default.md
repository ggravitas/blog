'A man with a conviction is a hard man to change,' is a quote from a 1950s study about how and why people believe lies. [The article](https://www.theatlantic.com/science/archive/2017/03/this-article-wont-change-your-mind/519093/) suggests that sometimes it is a fully conscious decision and/or a result of cognitive dissonance—the extreme discomfort of simultaneously holding two thoughts that are in conflict. "This doubling down in the face of conflicting evidence is a way of reducing the discomfort of dissonance, and is part of a set of behaviors known in the psychology literature as 'motivated reasoning.'" In other words, lying to ourselves because we want to identify so much with a group that accepting the lie is more confortable that examing the alternative.
