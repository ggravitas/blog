Interesting video interview with Amy Chua, Professor of Law at Yale Law School, who wrote a book, "Political Tribes: Group Instinct and the Fate of Nations." She argues that the worst debacles in U.S. foreign policy in the past 50 years, notably  Afghanistan and Iraq, but also Vietnam, were the result of failing to understand that the identities that matter most—the ones people will lay down their lives for—are not national but ethnic, regional, religious, sectarian, or clan-based. It was easy for us to overlook because generally that's not the American mindset, from a foreign policy point-of-view. But as it turns out, under certain circumstances, we are all hard-wired to “to demonize and de-humanize the out-group.” Those circumstances presented themselves to us in 2016.
