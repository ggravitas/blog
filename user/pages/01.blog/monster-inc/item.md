Omarosa is not your savior. Omarosa is a symptom of the media disease that encourages fame over substance and intelligence. She's an amoral, attention-seeking provocateur, which is what becomes of you in America when all you want is fame but have no talent. She's Trump. To pretend she suddenly has credibility because she provokes the media by being a back-stabbing grandstander has got my head spiraling into bizarro world. We are creating these monsters! Grow up America. Getting rid of these monsters is as easy as turning on the lights.
