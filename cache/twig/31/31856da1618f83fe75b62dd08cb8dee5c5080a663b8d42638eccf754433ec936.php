The Kavanaugh hearings this week just adds to the circus-like government we elected to guide us. I have little doubt he did what he was accused of ; I also have little doubt he has done good things and maybe is a good judge, too, unless he’s a sociopath. It’s a sign of our times to think people are just one thing or the other. The things he did or said to women in high school and college reflect the society we live in with complicity, too, where men – especially men with his pedigree – get a pass for all things untoward.

<p>Nevertheless, I’m against him because he’s playing the partisan game; instead of being judge-like, he’s being defiant and accusatory, which passes for character these days. It’s really cowardice. Of course, he is being attacked, so some of that would be natural for anyone; but he’s also about to be appointed to a lifetime position on our Supreme Court, so I expect more from him. I expect better nominees who are impartial and judge what’s best for the country, not an ideology. He’s an obvious toady groomed by the Federalist Society to ascend to this very position like a spy.</p>
<p>Kavanaugh plays the game just like all the Democrats and Republicans who continue to debase our country with this childishness. We need to hold people accountable for their behavior, yes, and it would be nice to have candidates who held themselves accountable as well. That’s character. The people and the process are wrong, and this was a bad week for the U.S. The world has been watching, and the world made it pretty clear what it thinks of us. The diplomats and leaders gathered in U.N. General Assembly this week laughed at Trump, and by association, us. We are becoming the laughingstock of the world. We can do better. We can always do better. I hope on Election Day you remember that.</p>";
