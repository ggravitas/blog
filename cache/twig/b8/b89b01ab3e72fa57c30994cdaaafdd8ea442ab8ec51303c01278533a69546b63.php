<p>When I was a journalist, especially when writing and editing for online news, I learned that everything depends on counting the clicks. Issues become trending when users – we’re not called “readers” anymore – click, share, or mention what was posted. Once just the purview of supermarket tabloids, a lot of an editor’s time at serious news outlets today is spent on crafting headlines that grab people’s – sorry – users’ attention. It’s called click bait, the tabloid algorithm.</p>
<p>The engine of our online commerce, more than \$325 billion a year in the U.S., runs on this model. Our media, mainstream and alternative, use the same tools to sell stories as companies use to sell widgets. Fact or fiction, the measurement of success is the same.

<p>You post your most adorable selfie and it gets 50 likes and 3 shares and you’re ecstatic, until three minutes later when you see someone else’s post got 100 likes and 5 shares, and so on. If you are motivated by fame, commerce, or both, you don’t have to be a genius to figure out the more provocative you are, the more attention you will get. This tabloid algorithm isn’t new; it’s just in our faces 24 hours a day.</p>
<p>This has given rise to the provocateur class. These are people who figured out that fame and infamy in our country are now the same thing. The figured out they can get you to click and buy ideas and widgets by being outrageous, politically or socially. In this type of society, you don’t have to be talented or smart or offer something useful, you just need to be a master of the tabloid algorithm; that, and be open to immorality. We have conspiracy theorists, and white supremacists running platforms that compete with real, professional, moral journalists. Our trending topics swing so far right and left hour by hour that this kind of society has to have a detrimental effect on our brains, our psyches, our souls. Pavlov had dogs salivating to a bell; our brains respond to Likes and Shares.</p>
<p>People motivated by this artificial algorithm of success have no choice but to continue to push our limits of outrage. Remember, back in 2016, when one of the trending topics was about the fear many had over how all the lies and provocation from the right would make it acceptable and normal? Guess what happened? What do you think the result will be when someone is handsomely rewarded for being a liar? What do you think the result will be when the provocateur class begins to rule the country and the media discourse? Is anyone really surprised that 12 mail bombs were delivered to opponents of the provocateurs? Perhaps you’re surprised it didn’t happen sooner?</p>
<p>I am truly frightened by what I’ve experienced these last few years; there doesn’t seem to be any good outcome if we continue this way. So here’s what I think we should do to help stop it. Put your money where your mouth is. First, invest in news, real, unbiased journalism reported by serious professionals. Support the truth and fact finding by subscribing to reliable sources of news. Here’s what I pay for: “NPR” (monthly donation), “The New York Times” (digital), “Foreign Affairs” (print &amp; digital), “The wall Street Journal” (digital), “Politifact” (donation), and “The New Yorker” (print &amp; digital). I occasionally watch PBS for NewsHour and Frontline; I watch BBC but don’t watch much cable (all paid through streaming services). I don’t pay for, but dip into, The Guardian, Politico, and The Hill. And I read the local paper at work. Overall, I believe this gives me a pretty balanced view of what is actually happening.</p>
<p>The second thing you can do is to invest in candidates you believe in. Donate to progressives or moderates, especially in races where the incumbents have been warming a seat far longer than is useful, right or left. This year was the first when I actually donated to candidates. I’ll admit, it felt a bit sordid, but then I reminded myself that corporations, in effect, can donate limitless funds to influence elections, and I want to help combat that.</p>
<p>I’m sure you can think of other ways to bring balance back to the force. Choose wisely, and be safe out there.</p>";
