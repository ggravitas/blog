####[Why Trump Supporters Believe He Is Not Corrupt](https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2018/08/what-trumps-supporters-think-of-corruption/568147/)
I've been trying to understand why Trump supporters are not as outraged by his obvious corruption as the rest of society. [This article](https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2018/08/what-trumps-supporters-think-of-corruption/568147/) has come as close as I've seen to an explanation. The article references a new book, "How Fascism Works," by a Yale philosophy professor, and the gist is that Trump supporters may actually see him as anti-corrupt because what they think is the real corruption are laws and societal values that violate what they see as Americaâ€™s traditional racial and sexual norms. "Once you grasp that for Trump and many of his supporters, corruption means less the violation of law than the violation of established hierarchies, their behavior makes more sense"
