The first principle is a respect for humanity. That is the most you should ever expect from anyone, and understand that is the most you owe anyone. All people, even deplorables, deserve basic human dignity, and with humanity comes certain inalienable rights that we must also respect. However, respecting humanity and those natural rights is not the same as respecting the person.
- I can respect you're right to an opinion, without respecting your opinion.
- I can respect your right to vote, without respecting your choice.
- I can respect your freedom of religion without respecting your beliefs.
- I can respect your right to life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness without respecting you.

Let's face it, there are deplorable people in the world, and, whether through ignorance or malice, they are bent on destroying what is fair and kind. Fair and kind people, on the other hand, try to be polite and respectful; we try to reason; we present facts and arguments. Today, none of that matters. You will not flip a Trump supporter with reason or decency. Some people are not deserving of our time or respect. We forget that too often. We point out because this blog is mostly about outrageous, deplorable things we are doing to each other in this country. So, undoubtedly, there wiil be posts with some pretty harsh words about the human zoo we live in, and when you criticize the harshness, you will be sent a link to this page.
