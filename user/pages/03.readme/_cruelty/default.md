####[The Cruelty Is the Point](https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2018/10/the-cruelty-is-the-point/572104/)

"The Trump era is such a whirlwind of cruelty that it can be hard to keep track," writes Adam Serwer in "[The Atlantic](https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2018/10/the-cruelty-is-the-point/572104/)." The article references some pretty heinous historical acts of cruelty; a cruelty that people, some people, seem to be particularly susceptible to. But there's also the childish cruelty in the way Trump mocks people, as he did this week of Christine Blasey Ford -- a sexual assault victim --, and anyone else who disagrees with him. But that's the point. Cruelty directed at a common foe, or perceived foe, is a way to bond. Children and adolescents do it every day. That's who runs this government.
