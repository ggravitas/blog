<p>I was first introduced to the Golden Rule in catechism when I was a child. Considered the center of Christian ethics, and attributed to Jesus from his Sermon on the Mount, (says Matthew), it was about the only thing I remembered from those religion classes, which, as it turned out, was the point.

<p>The next time I discussed the Golden Rule was in a philosophy class, in which I learned that every religion and ethical philosophy, even those predating Christianity, had some version of the Golden Rule. The professor told us that if we couldn’t remember anything else from the class, if we had no personal manifesto, no moral compass, or were perhaps sociopaths, the good news was that we only had to remember this one rule. </p>
<p>The problem with the Golden Rule, however, is pluralism. Today, we could even call it tribalism. We live in such a fractured society that assumptions about how others might want to be treated could be very different than our beliefs would have us guessing, especially if your neighbor is a sadomasochist or a member of the Republican Party (I couldn't resist). Proper use of the Rule presupposes that we share, at some level, a consensus of what our values are (see my post on <a href=\"http://outragefatigue.blog/blog/constitution\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" class=\"external-link no-image\">The Declaration of Independence</a>). But today, our values have not only shifted, they've shifted radically, and that throws the global application of the Rule out the window. “Just leave each other alone!” doesn't have the same positive spin.</p>
<p>If Wikipedia can be trusted, here are some versions of the Golden Rule:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>\"That which you hate to be done to you, do not do to another.\" –Ancient Egypt</p>
<p>\"Do not do to others what you know has hurt yourself\" –Ancient India</p>
<p>\"Avoid doing what you would blame others for doing.\" –Ancient Greece</p>
<p>\"Whatever is disagreeable to yourself do not do unto others.\" –Ancient Persia</p>
<p>\"Treat your inferior as you would wish your superior to treat you.\" –Ancient Rome</p>
<p>\"What you do not wish for yourself, do not do to others.\" –Confucianism</p>
<p>“You shall not take vengeance or bear a grudge against your kinsfolk. Love your neighbor as yourself: I am the LORD.” –Judaism</p>
<p>Do to others what you want them to do to you. This is the meaning of the law of Moses and the teaching of the prophets. –Christianity</p>
<p>\"Pay, Oh Children of Adam, as you would love to be paid, and be just as you would love to have justice!\" –Islam</p>
<p>“One should never do that to another which one regards as injurious to one’s own self. This, in brief, is the rule of dharma. Other behavior is due to selfish desires.” –Hinduism</p>
<p>“Hurt not others in ways that you yourself would find hurtful.” –Buddhism</p>
<p>“A man should wander about treating all creatures as he himself would be treated.” –Jainism</p>
