I’ve been trying to figure out what has happened to us, how we fell so disgracefully so quickly. I feel we are in a cold civil war and I fear the outcome will not be good. So instead of crawling under the covers or launching into spontaneous rants at the supermarket, I decided to start a blog, as you do. To be honest, I’m not too sure what it’s going to be about yet, but you can count on some ranting and raving. Or I might end up just posting pictures of my dog. </p>
<p>I’ve always been interested codes, as in “a code to live by” – a personal manifesto – so that makes me also interested in how people can so quickly and transparently disregard their beliefs, for something that seems so indecent and un-American. I hope to explore the philosophies that have influenced me while trying to figure out what the fuck happened to us. If you’re as mad as hell and don’t want to take it any more, help me explore these ideas, help me to understand them, and perhaps together we will solve every problem facing the world today … or perhaps that’s an overreach. </p>
