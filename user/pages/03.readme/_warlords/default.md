####[Yes, the U.S. sometimes supports warlords and dictators. So when should we stop?](https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/post-partisan/wp/2018/10/19/yes-the-u-s-sometimes-supports-warlords-and-dictators-so-when-should-we-stop/?utm_term=.7a73c20a9f85)
"The Washington Post" reminds us that the U.S. has a long history of supporting dictators when it suited us, especially during the Cold War. "A partial list includes: Fulgencio Batista, Anastasio Somoza, Ferdinand Marcos, Mobutu Sese Seko, Augusto Pinochet, Mohammad Reza Pahlavi (the former shah of Iran), Mohammed Zia ul-Haq, Syngman Rhee and Suharto." The maxim, “He may be an S.O.B., but he’s our S.O.B.” comes to mind in these ends justifies the means relationships. But America is supposed to stand for freedom, specifically freedom of speech, so when is enough, enough?
