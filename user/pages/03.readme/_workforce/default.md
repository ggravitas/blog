####[Freeing up U.S. labor markets would spread the benefits of growth more widely.](https://www.bloomberg.com/view/articles/2018-10-21/monopsony-power-holds-u-s-workers-back)

The "Bloomberg" Editorial board ask the question, "Why does the law of supply and demand no longer apply to the U.S. labor market? Employers keep hiring, pushing the unemployment rate to record lows. Yet wages have refused to rise as quickly as they have in the past." The opinion piece states that some assumptions the government makes when setting policy in a free market econonomy might be wrong, namely, the labor market isn’t free. A related story [U.S. Labor Markets Aren’t Truly Free](https://www.bloomberg.com/view/articles/2018-10-21/free-markets-could-make-workers-better-off), opens this way: "Karl Marx didn’t necessarily have 21st-century America in mind when he offered his dire assessment of the future of capitalism, predicting that workers’ pay would get squeezed to the point where the system would break down. Yet lately the U.S. has seemed to be heading in that direction."
